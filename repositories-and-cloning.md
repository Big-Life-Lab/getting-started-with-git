# Repositories and Cloning

Before you can start using various git features you have to first start or download a git project also called a **repository**. A git repository is just a folder on your computer that has git attached to it. There are 2 ways to create a git repository:

1. Downloading or **cloning** an existing repository
2. Starting your own repository

We will be focusing on the first way of starting a repository but if you are interested in number 2 these videos should help you:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXt95X8U1Dc Another video that goes over how to create a new repository.

Let's clone or download the GettingStartedWithGit repo (short for repository) into our computer. This article goes over how to do this in git kracken https://blog.axosoft.com/remote-repository/ and this is the link to the repo https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/GettingStartedWithGit.

If everything went well then you should have the repo on your computer. Congrats...you have successfully created a git repo!
