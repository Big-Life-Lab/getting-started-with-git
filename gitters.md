You can edit a file on the GitHub website by clicking the pencil button, but try editing the file on your computer using whatever editor you normally use to edit .md files. That way you see how GitKraken and local versions work. In your day-to-day work, you edit your program code in whatever editor you normally (SAS, RStudio, etc.) and then stage and push through GitKraken, or your program editor. Many of us at BLL like GitKraken in our git workflow.
